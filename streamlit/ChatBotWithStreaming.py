# The only difference so far is we've changed the title of our app and 
# added imports for random and time. We'll use random to randomly select 
# a response from a list of responses and time to add a delay to simulate 
# the chatbot "thinking" before responding.

# All that's left to do is add the chatbot's responses within the if block.
# We'll use a list of responses and randomly select one to display. We'll 
# also add a delay to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding 
# (or stream its response). Let's make a helper function for this and insert 
# it at the top of our app.

# Add assistant response to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})

# Above, we've added a placeholder to display the chatbot's response. 
# We've also added a for loop to iterate through the response and display 
# it one word at a time. We've added a delay of 0.05 seconds between each 
# word to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding. Finally, we 
# append the chatbot's response to the chat history. As you've probably guessed, 
# this is a naive implementation of streaming.
