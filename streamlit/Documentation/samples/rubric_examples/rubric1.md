### Detailed Rubric:

#### 1. Content and Relevance (20 Points)
- **17-20 Points**: Comprehensive, in-depth research that is highly relevant and enhances understanding significantly.
- **13-16 Points**: Solid research effort, relevant and informative, though some areas could be more detailed.
- **8-12 Points**: Adequate research with some relevant information, includes minor irrelevant details.
- **0-7 Points**: Insufficient depth, with many irrelevant sections.

#### 2. Organization and Structure (15 Points)
- **13-15 Points**: Exceptionally well-organized; logical flow enhances comprehension and adherence to the outline.
- **10-12 Points**: Well-organized, minor deviations from the ideal structure.
- **5-9 Points**: Some organizational issues; structure affects clarity.
- **0-4 Points**: Poor organization; significantly impacts readability.

#### 3. Use of Prompt Engineering (15 Points)
- **13-15 Points**: Highly effective and creative use of prompt engineering; results in relevant, high-quality content.
- **10-12 Points**: Good use of AI, generally aligns with content needs with minor issues.
- **5-9 Points**: Inconsistent effectiveness; prompt responses are somewhat relevant.
- **0-4 Points**: Ineffective use of prompt engineering with little relevance to the content.

#### 4. Writing Quality (15 Points)
- **13-15 Points**: Writing is clear, concise, and adheres to academic standards without grammatical errors.
- **10-12 Points**: Generally good writing quality, with few grammatical issues.
- **5-9 Points**: Several grammatical or stylistic errors; room for improvement.
- **0-4 Points**: Poor writing quality with numerous errors.

#### 5. Originality and Insight (10 Points)
- **9-10 Points**: Provides significant original thoughts and insightful analyses, offering unique perspectives or novel interpretations. Examples might include proposing new applications for LLMs, offering fresh ethical considerations, or novel comparisons of generative models.
- **6-8 Points**: Shows original thinking by presenting known information in new ways or linking concepts creatively. Offers fresh perspectives but does not fully explore new directions.
- **3-5 Points**: Limited originality, mostly restates known information with minimal new insights.
- **0-2 Points**: Entirely derivative, no original insights.

#### 6. Process Documentation and Evaluation of Prompt Techniques (25 Points)
- **21-25 Points**: Exceptional documentation of the prompting process, including detailed evaluations and comparisons, supported by relevant examples and evidence. Reflects deep understanding and critical analysis with in-depth discussions on each technique's effectiveness.
- **16-20 Points**: Good documentation with clear descriptions and evaluations, includes some comparative analysis and evidence, but lacks some depth in critical reflection.
- **8-15 Points**: Basic documentation, lacks depth in evaluations and comparative analysis, with minimal supporting evidence.
- **0-7 Points**: Inadequate documentation, minimal or no descriptions of processes, lacks critical evaluation.

This expanded rubric should better guide the assessment of students' work, emphasizing critical evaluation and original thought in their academic exploration.
