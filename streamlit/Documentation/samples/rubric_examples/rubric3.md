Given your scoring criteria and the distribution of emphasis across different aspects of the project, here's how we might allocate the 100 points across the categories:

### Point Allocation:
- **Justification of Technology Choices**: 10 points
- **Fine-Tuning of the LLM and Performance Analysis**: 40 points
- **Creativity**: 25 points
- **Professionalism in Presentation and Code**: 25 points

### Detailed Rubric:

#### 1. Justification of Technology Choices (10 Points)
- **8-10 Points**: Clear, concise, and logical explanations connecting technology choices to project needs.
- **5-7 Points**: Adequate explanation with minor gaps in logic or relevance.
- **0-4 Points**: Poorly explained or irrelevant justifications.

#### 2. Fine-Tuning of the LLM and Performance Analysis (40 Points)
- **35-40 Points**: Comprehensive and detailed process with a variety of training data, robust evaluation on new data, insightful performance analysis, clearly articulated challenges and well-considered future improvements.
- **25-34 Points**: Good detail and logical process, but may lack depth in performance analysis or suggestions for future work.
- **0-24 Points**: Inadequate detail, missing steps, unclear reasoning, or minimal analysis of challenges and improvements.

#### 3. Creativity (25 Points)
- **20-25 Points**: Demonstrates exceptional creativity in approach, problem-solving, and/or application features; goes well beyond the basic requirements.
- **15-19 Points**: Shows some creative elements but does not extensively explore new ideas or approaches.
- **0-14 Points**: Little to no creativity or original thought in project execution.

#### 4. Professionalism in Presentation and Code (25 Points)
- **20-25 Points**: Impeccable code documentation and comments, comprehensive README with appropriate licensing, proper source citation, and a professionally written report.
- **15-19 Points**: Generally well-documented and structured, minor issues in readability or completeness.
- **0-14 Points**: Lacks sufficient documentation, unclear or incomplete README, poor structure in the report, or missing citations.

This rubric ensures that students are rewarded for both meeting the basic requirements and for demonstrating exceptional skill or understanding in key areas.
