Here is a structured rubric for an AI-powered application project. It will focus on the thorough understanding and holistic effort of students, with special attention to the data collection process and the diversity of bot functionalities. Additionally, creativity in solution design and utility, along with comprehensive evaluation, will be key aspects.

### Point Allocation:
- **Data Collection and Bot Functionality**: 40 points
- **Creativity and Solution Utility**: 30 points
- **Evaluation and Testing Process**: 20 points
- **Professionalism**: 10 points

### Detailed Rubric:

#### 1. Data Collection and Bot Functionality (40 Points)
- **35-40 Points**: Exceptional variety in data collection sources and methods; the bot can perform complex and varied actions on the data that demonstrate deep integration and understanding.
- **25-34 Points**: Good variety and integration, but actions are somewhat basic or expected.
- **0-24 Points**: Limited data sources, minimal variety in bot actions, or poor integration of data with bot functionalities.

#### 2. Creativity and Solution Utility (30 Points)
- **25-30 Points**: Highly unique and useful application that solves a distinct problem, not commonly seen in existing tutorials; shows thoughtful backend AI development.
- **15-24 Points**: Some creative elements and utility but lacks uniqueness or substantial backend complexity.
- **0-14 Points**: Common solution with little creativity or practical usefulness.

#### 3. Evaluation and Testing Process (20 Points)
- **17-20 Points**: Thorough and well-documented testing and evaluation process; demonstrates understanding and addresses potential issues with detailed testing.
- **10-16 Points**: Adequate testing but lacks depth or comprehensive evaluation.
- **0-9 Points**: Minimal or superficial testing and evaluation.

#### 4. Professionalism (10 Points)
- **9-10 Points**: Code is well-documented and easy to understand; comprehensive README with appropriate licensing, correct source citations, and a professionally structured report.
- **5-8 Points**: Generally well-documented, minor issues in readability or completeness.
- **0-4 Points**: Lacks sufficient documentation or professional presentation.

This rubric aims to reward students for exceptional understanding, creativity, and thorough evaluation, while ensuring that the basic requirements are met for a solid foundational score.
